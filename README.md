### DANKOBADGES

So my Son Jonathan and I decided late one evening to pair on a project. 

Jonathan says "Badges seemed cool, the pretzel was awesome." Jonathan also says "It's fine with me if someone else wants to work on it too, so we have other people that can help work on it. I didn't say to put that on there. For real. Daddy! Why are you doing this? ERASE THAT! PLEASE! I'M NOT KIDDING" -- all while laughing really hard. 

"No, for real, I didn't want you to put that on there. DADDY!"

We'll continue to work on some of these when we have time. 

No, he didn't do the FAYLIX one.
